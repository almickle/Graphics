# Graphics

This is a small personal project of mine as I was learning about the fundamentals of 3D rendering. It is custom render engine built from scratch using
only vanilla javascript. Performance is obviously poor but it is nonetheless amazing that raw code can be used to produce an actively animated 3D object. 

Building this was really fun and I learned a ton. Feel free to browse the code. It's really cool to watch the teapot spin!
